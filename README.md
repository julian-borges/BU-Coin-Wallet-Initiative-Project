## Project Overview

**BU Coin** is a pilot initiative to design and implement a **university-native, blockchain-powered digital currency** for Boston University. This project proposes a decentralized token system that enhances payment accessibility, reduces administrative costs, and gamifies student engagement.

BU Coin is not just a payment tool—it's a strategic platform for delivering seamless, low-cost, transparent, and programmable transactions across campus services including tuition, dining, laundry, events, and more.
